# Turbowarp: Muser Windows 11: Debug
## The beta versions is only for PRO users
I can barely say, this is only feature in beta. So please don't say that does not exist because you don't search properly. 
## The "ViewAllVariables"
(DEPRECATED): This option makes every variable visible. ***Reason of deprecating: Too many variables on project, and we cannot just use block  `Show All Variables`, because Turbowarp (eg. Scratch) does not have block `Show All Variables`, and if it had, we need `Hide All Variables` too. Even for developers of Turbowarp, it is hard to do.***
## The "noBetaWarnText"
This option let user hide text with beta version. Only in not Debug UI.
## The "debugTestUI"
This option changes User Interface to it's debug version

### Notes
> You wanted personalization on debug ui? Here it is. But, anything WILL have bugs. After setting theme, ***you need to minimize, and maximize windows to take changes apply.*** Currently, personalization can't do changes to Debug Menu, because it is from original system. (This note is'nt effective now)

> In Version 4, we want to make more info and app control, with loading screen and more tests. That will take from us more time.
