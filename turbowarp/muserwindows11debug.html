<p>I can barely say, this is only feature in beta. So please don&#39;t say that does not exist because you don&#39;t search properly. </p>
<h2 id="the-viewallvariables-">The &quot;ViewAllVariables&quot;</h2>
<p>(DEPRECATED): This option makes every variable visible. <strong><em>Reason of deprecating: Too many variables on project, and we cannot just use block  <code>Show All Variables</code>, because Turbowarp (eg. Scratch) does not have block <code>Show All Variables</code>, and if it had, we need <code>Hide All Variables</code> too. Even for developers of Turbowarp, it is hard to do.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="the-nobetawarntext-">The &quot;noBetaWarnText&quot;</h2>
<p>This option let user hide text with beta version. Only in not Debug UI.</p>
<h2 id="the-debugtestui-">The &quot;debugTestUI&quot;</h2>
<p>This option changes User Interface to it&#39;s debug version

<p>You wanted personalization on debug ui? Here it is. But, anything WILL have bugs. After setting theme, <strong><em>you need to minimize, and maximize windows to take changes apply.</em></strong> Currently, personalization can&#39;t do changes to Debug Menu, because it is from original system. (This note is&#39;nt effective now)

You wanted personalization on debug ui? Here it is. But, anything WILL have bugs. After setting theme, <strong><em>you need to minimize, and maximize windows to take changes apply. If the app is Debug Menu, all you need to do is nothing.</em></strong> (This note is effective now)
<br><br>
Now, background changes text and icon colours if the theme is changing!
<br><br>
In Version 4, we want to make more info and app control, with loading screen and more tests. That will take from us more time.
<br><br>
We did it. You can access to start now, find link to this page, see how it loads and try to test minigame. (window can be dragged, and player&#39;s position does not reset.)</p>
